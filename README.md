# v1.5.0

## Release on

14 August, 2021

## What's in this release

![OSlash ‚ù§Ô∏è Firefox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getoslash/changelog/main/assets/images/v1.5.0-oslash-firefox.png)

We love Firefox and everything that Mozilla stands for; so we now extend the love with a Firefox-compatible version of our OSlash extension! We've also fixed a few issues that users had reported.

### ‚ú® Features

1. Firefox support ü•≥

    OSlash now supports Firefox ü•≥. We heard from a lot of teams that love OSlash that they prefer Firefox, and so we set out to bring the same experience to a whole new browser. Our stellar engineering team was able to build it out in under a week, thanks to a solid and future-proof foundation (hint: we're also [hiring](https://www.oslash.com/careers)!)

### üõ† Bug fixes and improvements

* The OSlash Pin is slightly smaller than the last version. We heard from a lot of users that it was a smidge too big, so we've made it a size that works for everyone.

* When users were invited to an OSlash workspace, we used to create an additional personal workspace by default ‚Äì we learnt from users that this was confusing, so we've stopped creating the personal workspace by default. Having said that, you can still create it yourself.
