We‚Äôre introducing a brand new **Slack** integration ‚Äì look up, discover, and share your OSlash Shortcuts with your Slack team. We‚Äôve also been actively listening to user feedback; and so we‚Äôve given the OSlash browser extension a fresh coat of paint ‚Äì things are now easier to find and friendlier to navigate. And as always, we‚Äôve included a whole host of fixes and improvements to make sure you can keep using OSlash carefree.

### ‚ú® Features

1. A new Slack app

    Add the brand new OSlash Slack app to your workspace to get all the Shortcut goodness right inside Slack. Note that this feature is being gradually rolled out to customers globally.

2. Layout & usability changes

    * Your private, public, & shared Shortcuts are now easier to search for and visually differentiate.

    * Quickly find your favourite Shortcut with the new `Ctrl + F` or `‚åò + F` keyboard shortcut.

    * Quickly switch your OSlash workspace with the new `Ctrl + Alt + <number>` or `‚åò + Option + <number>` keyboard shortcut.

    * Now you can invite multiple folks to your OSlash workspace in one go.

3. OSlash changelog

    A new page that will display new product updates and features is now included in the extension. In fact, you‚Äôre reading this on that very page!

4. Redesigned browser popup

    We‚Äôve listened to you, and the redesigned browser popup makes it faster and simpler to create a new shortcut or edit an existing one.

5. Support & help via Intercom

    We‚Äôve added a new help section in the Dashboard sidebar so it is easier for you to reach out to us.

### üõ† Bug fixes and improvements

* Previously deleted users can now be invited again! We‚Äôre sorry for this, because we sincerely believe in second chances.

* A new user-friendly error page will be shown when a Shortcut does not exist.

* Members will be updated about pending invites when a new invite is sent out.

* Once users log in with the extension, they are also logged into their workspaces automatically.

* If you were one of the unfortunate few who faced errors while opening shortcuts, worry no more, as we‚Äôve fixed that for you.

* A much cooler login page.
